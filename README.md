# What is Movies Man ?!

* Every time we try to have a movie night or just we've a free time and we want to watch a movie, we stuck in our main every time problem which is "What movie should I see today ?".
In my opinion we all get stuck in this every day and every night, but finally from now on we won't stuck again.

* Movies Man would solve our every time problem by recommending a movie for us through an interesting game all you need is try to guess the movie name by using the letters in a way which looks like hangman games. When you reach the movie name you've the ability to view the whole movie information which is totally correct as all our information is from IMDb official website.

* We're trying to make it easy for you just when you decide to watch a movie all you've to do is get your mobile phone, open up Movies Man, start playing till you find a movie that gets you interested.

* You can play as much as you want as our database has 200+ movies and it'll be always updated. If you have any problem with Movies Man or you want to recommend a new features for the next versions, you can use "Contact-Us" in Movies Man and we'll be in touch as soon as possible.
